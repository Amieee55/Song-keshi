            <h3><em>[Verse 1]</em></h3>
        <pre>
            Hold on, you're letting go 
            I don't wanna lose you, <em>baby</em>
            Feels like you're getting cold
            I can't seem to reach you lately
            But you turn your <strong>blade</strong>
            With every shot you take
            If it's love that you wanted
            You'd put your pride away          
        </pre>
        <pre>
            Too late, we're bleeding out
            I can barely hear your heartbeat
            <em>Breaking</em>, we're going down
            If I hold you close, then maybe
            So I try to stay
            Just for old time's sake
            But you <em>waited and waited</em>
            So I can feel the <strong>pain</strong>
        </pre>
            <h3><em>[Chorus]</em></h3>
        <pre>
            Since you wanna go to <strong>war</strong>
            Let's see who hurts the other <strong>more</strong>
            You always got something you wanna prove
            And I've got nothing left to <strong>lose</strong>
            Don't know what we're fighting for
            I'm tired of going <strong>back</strong> and <strong>forth</strong>
            You always got something you wanna prove
            <em>And I've got nothing left to lose</em>
        </pre>
            <h3><em>[Verse 2]</em></h3>
        <pre>
            Built walls, drawn lines
            Look at what we've come to lately
            Broke glass, spilled wine
            Caught up in the crossfire, baby
            Nothing left to say
            <em>You can have your way</em>
            If it's this that you wanted
            Then I would've <strong>stayed away</strong>
        </pre>
        <pre>
            <strong>Too much, </strong><em>not enough</em>
            Just to end up broken-hearted
            We ran outta love
            Tryna finish what we started
            But you always stay
            Just for old time's sake
            Just to see if we make it
            You never felt the <em>same</em>
        </pre>
            <h3><em>[Outro Chorus]</em></h3>
        <pre>
            Since you wanna go to war
            Let's see who hurts the other more
            You always got something you wanna prove
            And I've got nothing left to <strong>lose</strong>
            Don't know what we're fighting for
            I'm <em>tired</em> of going back and forth
            You always got something you wanna prove
            <i>And I've got nothing left to lose</i>
        </pre>
